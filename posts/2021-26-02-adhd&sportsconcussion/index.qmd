### Diagnosed and Nondisclosed Sport-Related Concussion: An Exploratory Comparison Study by ADHD Status in Collegiate Athletes

#### Beidler, E., Schmitt, A.J., Matta, M., & Griger, C. (2022)

To determine if ADHD status in collegiate athletes was associated with differences in the number of diagnosed and nondisclosed sport-related concussions, and reasons why suspected concussive injuries were not reported. Method: A cross-sectional survey was completed by 858 collegiate athletes (65 with ADHD; 793 without ADHD). The survey included self-report items regarding ADHD status and histories of diagnosed and nondisclosed sport-related concussions. Groups were matched for gender, age, and sport with a ratio of one participant with ADHD to four without ADHD. Results: Collegiate athletes with ADHD reported significantly more diagnosed sport-related concussions and were more likely to have a history of diagnosis compared to those without ADHD. There were no significant differences between groups regarding sport-related concussion nondisclosure history. Conclusion: Collegiate athletes with ADHD have an increased prevalence rate of diagnosed sport-related concussions compared to those without ADHD; however, this developmental disorder may not influence injury nondisclosure decisions.
