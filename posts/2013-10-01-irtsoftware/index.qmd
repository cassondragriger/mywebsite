### Equity Implications of Open-Source and Subscription-Based IRT Software: A Comparison of Scored Performance

#### Bediwy, A., Depuy, N., & Griger, C. (2022)

Equitable technology in education describes the access of technology-based resources to learners,regardless of cultural, ethnic, or financial status. In higher education, access to accurate andreliable technology is still a hurdle for individuals due to cost and access to adjacent resourcessuch as mentors and computers. In order to inform communities on the efficacy of and access totechnology for IRT analysis, this study examines the differences of applicable software that are either open-source or subscription-based. Item and person traits and standard errors of ashortened Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices test were estimated through CTT and IRTparameterization strategies with a three-parameter logistic model (3PL) and a nominal responsemodel (NRM) to showcase differences amongst available technologies.
