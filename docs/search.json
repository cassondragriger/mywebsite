    "text": "Mapping of Pediatric Chronic Illness Sequelae to Inform Evaluation Planning\n\nBenno, M. T., Griger, C., Tracy, B., Nayyar, A., Conaway, R. B., Franklin, K., & Schmitt, A. J. (2021)\nPediatric chronic illnesses are characterized as conditions that last one year or more, require continuous medical intervention, and have implications for the overall functioning, including neuropsychoeducational functioning, of a child. Students with chronic illnesses are at risk for compromised cognitive and physical functioning, resulting in a wide range of academic, emotional, behavioral, and daily living difficulties. Due to the psychoeducational challenges that face students with pediatric conditions, eligibility for special education services under the category of other health impairment (OHI) must be considered. Establishing if a student with a chronic illness qualifies for special education services requires the learner to be evaluated in “all areas of suspected disability” (IDEA, 2004). School psychologists must therefore be prepared to develop comprehensive evaluation plans that consider specific referral questions posed by parents and educators and explore the known neuropsychoeducational sequelae of particular pediatric conditions. The purpose of this study was to support school psychologist evaluation planning by identifying pediatric conditions commonly encountered in the educational setting and then adopting a school neuropsychological assessment approach to investigate the neuropsychoeducational domains for which “limited” performance at home, at school, and in the community may be expected. In turn, these might become targets of assessment within a comprehensive evaluation plan. In other words, this study asks: for pediatric chronic health conditions commonly encountered by school psychologists, what are the neuropsychoeducational domains for which performance differences are present and in turn be considered suspected areas of disability?"

    "text": "Doctorate Program Needs Assessment\n\nWuenschell, E., Jancart, C., Ozanich, A., Griger, C., & Crothers, L. (2020)\nThe Duquesne University School Psychology Program invited their graduate students to assess the program’s diversity and inclusivity practices and policies. As the demographic characteristics of the university’s student population becomes more diverse, secondary educational institutions accordingly must adjust their curricula, practices, and policies. Through this project, we disseminated a survey to Duquesne School Psychology stakeholders in order to gain information about their opinions on current practices and recommendations for future changes to the program’s policies and procedures. The survey respondents indicated that the current practices and policies are not consistently implemented across the program. The data indicated that the inclusion of multicultural faculty and students was a top priority, compared to other recommendations. Qualitative responses prioritized communication, data-based decision makings, and professional development. Similarly, the focus group discussed communication issues, along with other potential adjustments to policy. Recommendations for changes to retention and recruitment procedures of diverse faculty and students are discussed. Potential obstacles, including responsibility, practicality, longevity and evaluation of success are also reviewed as a commentary on the nature of this issue and tendency for issues to fade over time.\nBased on the data collected, the following recommendations are suggested:\n\nEstablish progress monitoring tools for use in a yearly review of diversity and inclusivity goals\nDevelop a diversity plan that is a productive, strategic start to ensuring that social justice is a priority in our values and practices\nAdapt the recruitment and retention plan by offering flexible programming for students to receive additional support if they are unable to meet program admission criteria\nWeigh personal statements, letters of recommendations, and faculty interviews as a higher priority in admission decisions, and de-prioritize Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores\nConcentrate on hiring adjunct professors who are actively practicing in the field of school psychology, as faculty\nIncorporate social justice into the school psychology curriculum by having difficult conversations, additional readings, and being involved in the surrounding communities\nIncrease community outreach events for all students, staff, and faculty\nContinue faculty education by engagement in ongoing professional development; promoting all faculty having an active, equal role to ensure investment and mutual education regarding specific areas of interest\nIncrease faculty’s knowledge of financial resources and support for students\nHighlight alumni successes, increase networking opportunities for students, and increase communication from the program with alumni\nCreate a diversity plan and a council of students, faculty, and staff to execute an ongoing assessment of recruitment practices, admissions processes, and curricula\nConnect students with BIPOC faculty within the university, focusing on cultivating cultural, spiritual, and academic connections. This type of mentorship program would feature face-to-face meetings, research and writing support, and professional development"

    "text": "I grew up in Dingmans Ferry, a rural town nestled in the Poconos that is known for its hiking and scenic waterfalls. As a child, I was always outside taking in my natural surroundings and identifying patterns to solve my imaginary problems in play.\nFast forward to 2013, I began a career in solving real world problems with pattern detection of cognitive agents used for math education in Pittsburgh. After conferring my masters in child psychology, I naturally transitioned to a Ph.D. in school psychology. While practicing, I noticed critical inefficiencies and inequities of modern psychoeducational measurement. To pursue this research with aligned support, I connected with Jonathan Templin, Ph.D., a globally-respected scholar in quantitative methods for measurement, and consequently transferred to Iowa.\nAlong the way, I’ve held side careers in mixology and woodworking, which have allowed me to foster closer connections with my communities and express my creativity. On the weekends in Pittsburgh, you could find me either behind the bar mixing up classic cocktails or in the urban makerspace teaching a charcuterie board class. Alongside my studies in Iowa, I continue to woodwork with friends and try out DIY home renovations."

    "text": "Investigating the Effect of Meta-Cognitive Scaffolding for Learning by Teaching\n\nMatsuda, N., Griger, C. L., Barbalios, N., Stylianides, G., Cohen, W. W., & Koedinger, K. R. (2014)\nThis paper investigates the effect of meta-cognitive help in the context of learning by teaching. Students learned to solve algebraic equations by tutoring a teachable agent, called SimStudent, using an online learning environment, called APLUS. A version of APLUS was developed to provide meta-cognitive help on what problems students should teach, as well as when to quiz SimStudent. A classroom study comparing APLUS with and without the meta-cognitive help was conducted with 173 seventh to ninth grade students. The data showed that students with the meta-cognitive help showed better problem selection and scored higher on the post-test than those who tutored SimStudent without the meta-cognitive help. These results suggest that, when carefully de-signed, learning by teaching can support students to not only learn cognitive skills but also employ meta-cognitive skills for effective tutoring.\n\nMy primary responsibilities on the SimStudent project concerned improvements in cognitive modeling of a computer agent through direct observation of user interaction and data mining.\n\nPre-process output data from Oracle database to discover patterns and bugs within the production files\nConduct descriptive and inferential analyses, and produce data visualizations for PI team on monthly basis\nAnalyze reliability on measures of human student knowledge gains\nExamine cognitive fidelity by disentangling computer agent errors that impact human student’s learning and validating production rules using Minerva via Cygwin\nManage projects through recruiting stakeholders, training research assistants, create and maintain IRB documentation, scheduling and managing classroom and lab studies, data analysis, journaling all procedures \nWorked closely with programmer to fine tune production rules and interface based on analyses"

(2022)\nTo determine if ADHD status in collegiate athletes was associated with differences in the number of diagnosed and nondisclosed sport-related concussions, and reasons why suspected concussive injuries were not reported. Method: A cross-sectional survey was completed by 858 collegiate athletes (65 with ADHD; 793 without ADHD). The survey included self-report items regarding ADHD status and histories of diagnosed and nondisclosed sport-related concussions. Groups were matched for gender, age, and sport with a ratio of one participant with ADHD to four without ADHD. Results: Collegiate athletes with ADHD reported significantly more diagnosed sport-related concussions and were more likely to have a history of diagnosis compared to those without ADHD. There were no significant differences between groups regarding sport-related concussion nondisclosure history. Conclusion: Collegiate athletes with ADHD have an increased prevalence rate of diagnosed sport-related concussions compared to those without ADHD; however, this developmental disorder may not influence injury nondisclosure decisions."

    "text": "Biased Problem Distributions in Assignments Parallel Those in Textbooks: Evidence From Fraction and Decimal Arithmetic\n\nTian, J., Leib, E.R., Griger, C., Oppenzato, C.O. , & Siegler, R.S. (2022)\nImbalances in problem distributions in math textbooks have been hypothesized to influence students’ performance. This hypothesis, however, rests on the assumption that textbook problems are representative of the problems that students encounter in classroom assignments. This assumption might not be true, because teachers do not present all problems in textbooks and because teachers present problems from sources other than textbooks. To test whether distributions of problems that students encounter parallel distributions of textbook problems, we analyzed fraction and decimal arithmetic problems assigned by 14 teachers over an entire school year. Five of the six documented biases in textbook problem distributions were also present in the classroom assignments. Moreover, the same biases were present in 16 of the 18 combinations of bias and grade level (4th, 5th, and 6th grade) that were examined in assignments and textbooks. Theoretical and educational implications of these findings are discussed.\nTian, Leib, Griger, Oppenzato, & Siegler (2022).pdf){width=“100%” height=“100%” style=“min-height:100vh;”}"
